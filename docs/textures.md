## Our Research

*Torn Apart* aggregates and cross-references publicly available data to visualize the geography of Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy and iterate our attention to the landscapes, families, and communities riven by the massive web of immigrant detention in the United States.

Working nimbly and remotely from four sites in the United States over a six-day period, our small team of researchers set about identifying sources of data on immigrant detention, from ports of entry run by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers, to shelters subcontracted by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to care for children in their custody, to the financial trails left by a network of public, private, and non-profit organizations complicit with the complex infrastructure of immigrant detention in the United States. 

Our sources for obtaining the [data](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/credits.html) were varied. Those we worked from included a FOIA-ed list of ICE facilities, publicly available lists of CBP sites, data sets of ICE detainee hearings, state childcare licensing databases, government grant awards lists, and USASpending.gov. We cross-checked our data through non-governmental sources as well: news reports about immigrant detention, business databases, tax documents for non-profit organization, job advertisements, Google Maps entries, Facebook Places, and more. All of our data has been verified through a minimum of [two sources](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/bibliography.html), at least one directly from the government. 

What our data has revealed is a shadowy network of government facilities, subcontractors from the prison-industrial complex, “non-profit” administrators paid over half a million dollars a year, and religious organizations across the country that, together, prop up the immigrant detention machine. Immigrant detention is a multi-billion dollar business and it’s happening in our own backyards. The crisis for immigrants in the United States is not only happening at the Mexico-United States border or other ports of entry. Rather, the border is everywhere. 

This is not to say that *Torn Apart*, now in alpha release, paints a complete picture of immigrant detention. Like all maps, ours is a representation of data, reflecting choices we made while designing visualizations. A simple decision to place data points in the foreground, rather than in the background as we have done, offers a very different reading of the locations of ICE detention centers, as the map below demonstrates.

Our desire to ensure accuracy also led to decisions to not include public data we could not verify. For example, numbers of beds in ORR shelters, which can be found through government and state sources, might seem to offer a picture of the numbers of children in ORR custody, but our research revealed that some of those organizations also work with Child Protective Services. As a result,it’s unclear exactly what percentage of children in ORR shelters are, in fact, in the ORR system. At a moment when there is significant confusion about the exact whereabouts of migrant children who have been separated from their parents, we did not want to add an additional layer of confusion by suggesting that children might be in places they are not.   

We also had some difficult political and ethical choices to make about data that should and should not made available to the public, and we revisited our decisions daily. Revealing the addresses of these facilities, particularly the ORR children’s shelters, was a matter of great concern. While we were using publicly available data, aggregating it in a single place seemed a potentially dangerous choice and a road map to an already vulnerable population, or to preempt careful organization by activists. Thus, by mapping detention facilities at the city and state level, we circumvented this danger while still achieving our goal of accurately depicting the vast geographical sweep of immigrant detention in the United States. While we have a reliable data set of names of children’s shelters, we did not include the names because quick Google searches lead to street addresses.

As we cross-referenced our findings among these sources, we found ourselves down rabbit holes revealing the more human and heartbreaking dimensions of immigrant detention. Below is just a sample.


### Googling “Where are the children?”

We can find almost anything on Google these days, so perhaps it’s no surprise desperate parents are using it to [find their detained children](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/435mqd/how-charities-are-trying-to-reunite-separated-immigrant-families). While researching shelters subcontracted by ORR, Roopika came across this curious use of Google business listings. On the listing below for a shelter run by [Southwest Key](http://www.swkey.org), a Latinx-run “non-profit” that has [received nearly $1B](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/search/281d94b393e15b6a0caf31afd04d1261) in government contracts and grants over the last four years, a horrifying note from a parent pleads, “I need information about my daughter.” [Let me Google that for you](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=where+is+my+detained+child%3F) has never been so tragic.

### Rate My Detention Center

Facebook has been [rightly chastised this year](https://www.amazon.com/Antisocial-Media-Disconnects-Undermines-Democracy/dp/0190841168) for the way their mediascape has undermined democracy and careful deliberation. Along with the bi-partite siloes of the current moment, many of its lesser known corners are haunted with the everyday textures of our American fright night. During our research, we visited some of the pages that Facebook seems to generate automatically from other directories of Detention Centers—at the very least, they are marked as “unofficial.” On those pages we found pleas similar to the ones we found in Google searches, but we also found selfies of families in cars checking in at facilities to visit loved ones, notes full of heart emojis and well wishes from friends, the disembodied voice of a child offering a glowing review of his stay at an ORR shelter from his mother’s Facebook account, and much more. Because of Facebook's web architecture, we were struck by the way that families were using their review system for their own purposes, reinforcing for us [the hope of technological disobedience](http://www.technologicaldisobedience.com/). 

After Alex [tweeted a screenshot](https://twitter.com/elotroalex/status/1008896200869908481) of one of these pages, Rachelle Hampton at Slate took on the specific challenge of investigating them. The result was her story, "[Family Members of Detainees Are Reviewing Border Detention Centers on Facebook](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/06/detainees-family-members-are-reviewing-border-detention-centers-on-facebook-and-google.html)." Now, members of the public are filling these pages with demands for [accountability and transparency](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Southwest-Key-Programs/463839093693174).

### The Banality of Annual Reports

In "Registering the Handicapped in Nazi Germany: A Case Study," Henry Friedlander reminds us that infrastructures building on one another, fueled by racist ideology and operating in relative shadows, can lead to a final infrastructure. Part of the fuel for our own project is keeping the spotlight fixed on the massive infestation of immigration detention centers in the United States today and iterating the *long history of tearing families apart*(https://me.me/i/martha-s-jones-marthasjones-forcibly-separating-parents-from-children-has-22176180) in the national fevers of the United States. Though these companies were relatively obscure until very recently, the way they are run is all too familiar. Part of our research brought us to company sites and business databases behind the paywalls. What we found was the usual paraphernalia of management culture, including their annual reports. Below you can see how American management culture, in the compulsion for spin, betrays the racist nature of the operation they "serve."

Sensing that their shadows were dissipating, some of these companies began to stand out from the others for not being the ones with these kids. Others, though, began the all too familiar process of deleting their records. Below is the 404 page that sits now where the above GIF came from.

### The Detention Gold Rush

Immigrant detention is not just big business, it is "job creation." While just a year ago non-profit organizations housing children in ORR custody engaged in [massive layoffs](http://valleycentral.com/news/local/southwest-key-program-conducts-mass-layoffs-due-to-recent-decline-in-immigration), the “zero tolerance” immigration policy has led to a hiring spree. A barely over minimum wage hiring spree, but [only the best](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/southwest-key-hired-child-case-manager-previously-arrested-child-pornography/) for migrant children. After all, they sometimes even want an employee who’s bilingual. Then again, not all brown immigrants [speak Spanish](https://twitter.com/minh81/status/1009892301433458688).

As our experiences show, wading into the waters of public information on immigrant detention is a decision that shouldn’t be undertaken lightly. It must be done with the safety of migrants and asylum-seekers at the forefront. Researchers must also be aware that this work can be taxing on the spirit. Exposure to this level of cruelty is probably best handled by those who feel prepared to fix their eyes on intimate horrors and still fight on with clarity of mind and a stout will. We urge you take care of yourself at the same time as you care for others, through this work.

What we have demonstrated here is that a small team of researchers with varied skill sets—librarians, graduate students, literary scholars, and historians—and experience with digital humanities can pool their expertise to respond quickly, yet carefully, in a time of crisis. While *Torn Apart* is one iteration of our work, we are able to deploy our data to other teams that wish to use it in new ways.
