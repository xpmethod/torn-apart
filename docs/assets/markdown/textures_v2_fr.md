## Take Two

As the team behind *Torn Apart/Separados*, Vol. 1 visualized the carceral geographies of immigrant detention in the United States, we kept circling back to questions we couldn’t quite answer at the time: How many tax dollars does it take to support the shadowy web of ICE infrastructure we were seeing? Whose coffers are swelling with the spoils of detaining migrants? Has the financial landscape changed over time? And to what extent do the numbers of available detention centers and government funds allocated to ICE collectively point to the United States government’s readiness to expand ICE operations at a moment’s notice.

These questions lie at the heart of *Torn Apart/Separados*, Vol. 2, a deep dive into the financial heart of immigrant detention in the United States. Through new data visualizations created by a team of both original and new members, we follow the money, untangling the fiscal particularities of ICE. These visualizations, inspired by data from ICE contracts between fiscal years 2014 and 2018 scraped from [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/), range from concrete depictions of government contracting to a granular account of numbers of lives torn apart at deportation points.

Our “Districts” map visualizes the total number of ICE dollars flowing into congressional districts, along with information about each district's largest recipient of ICE money and elected representative. “Rain" demonstrates the explosive growth of ICE contract values over time. Through “Gain” we expose the most egregious participants in ICE’s operations, from prison services to businesses owned by people of color to well-known companies to universities. In “Freezer” we document the range of goods, services, and contractors that prop up the immigration enforcement machine. “Lines” puts these expenditures in haunting context through its representation of deportations since 2012 by port of removal. Finally, "Allies," a new map, updates the ally list in Volume 1 and presents the data geo-spatially.


## Follow the Money, See Where It Goes

“Socks are needed for detainee welfare,” or so reads a description of $11,305 of goods and services provided by MI Click Marketing to ICE in fiscal year 2018. Boys’ jackets for upstate New York winters ($9,528), tampons for detainees at Port Isabel Service Processing Center in Texas ($4999.50), Catholic Mass ($3,502,726.01), boxed lunches served on charter flights carrying out deportation orders ($36,157.44). Amid the five billion dollars awarded to government contractors by ICE in fiscal year 2018 alone, these ordinary expenditures serve as a stirring reminder of the people behind the numbers in our visualizations. These precarious human lives, trapped in the web of ICE operations, dwell in the purgatory of the U.S. executive's state of exception where, as of our release date, hundreds of immigrant children remain separated from their families.

Simply unraveling this data took us down the rabbit holes of government contracting, where awards are documented in excruciating detail for “transparency.” Each award links to a wealth of data, from recipient name to
congressional district to bid process to contract modifications, and more. The discrepancies between the first chart we created based on the data set and the updated version illustrate our initial missteps while working with this data.

#IMGTAG#

Our first chart demonstrates the challenges of making sense of this data and inaccurately includes contract modifications in calculations of current and potential
contract values. Through our research, however, we recognized that these
values were wildly incongruent with ICE budgets and took this moment of realization
as a sign that we needed to spend significantly more time than we had anticipated learning the nuances of government contracting before committing to
a set of visualizations. As we worked, we developed a [cheat
sheet](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data/blob/master/cheat_sheet.md) for the columns of data that accompany each award to track their definitions. We then dug more deeply into the categories, wondering what they had to say in conversation with each other.

While the sheer volume of money poured into ICE operations and its startling increase over time is enough of a story, we found other stories hidden in the data. Quantities of goods and services that support detention, enforcement, and deportation are overwhelming. Mundane awards for toilet paper, spray cleaner, and lotion are juxtaposed with carceral technologies: armored vehicles, body armor, and tasers. Ordinary goods and services that bespeak the banality of evil can be overshadowed by unfathomable sums spent on titans of the prison industry now in the immigrant detention game: $438,379,354.01 to GEO Group, $120,431,609.32 to MVM, and $151,008,676.20 to CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America) in 2018 alone.

Within the data, we found commonplace companies like Amazon, platforms like RStudio that support digital humanities research, scholarly knowledge cartels like Elsevier, universities like Johns Hopkins, periodicals like *The Economist*, and popular websites like LinkedIn. Good news, Mac users: Apple isn’t in the ICE contract game. But if you have a Dell, well, you may have bigger problems.

How to effectively convey these stories was itself a matter of debate that reflects the ethical commitments of our team. While Vol. 1’s ethical questions focused on the safety of detained children, here we grappled with a different challenge: how do we visualize financial data for data storytelling without distorting or misrepresenting it? This was, in part, the result of the limitations of representing money through 2-dimensional shapes, where sizes of objects can show relative differences in value but are less reliable for absolute value. But this was also a matter of how we told our stories.

Designing “Gain” was a crucial moment where these tensions came to the fore. The idea behind this visualization was to feature the most stunning examples of collusion with immigration enforcement through companies and institutions named on the "Scroll of Shame”—some for their grotesque profits, some for their curious presence in the data set, others for their household names. On our original “Wall of Shame,” a play on a word cloud, we had to scale the data so the smallest words were still visible while the largest ones still fit the page.

For example, Geo Group should actually be 72,2843 times as large as UPS (the smallest item on the word cloud) and 3.6 times as large as Corrections Corporation of America (the second-largest). However, these sizes weren’t possible to represent without logarithmic scaling, which obscures both the absolute and relative dollar values. Our final decision to create a "Scroll of Shame" avoids this issue by simply displaying contractor names and award values.

We also originally created “Equal Opportunity Oppression” pie charts representing the participation of people of color, women, and women of color in ICE contracts. Working with this data was a puzzle: in accordance with Equal Opportunity laws, the United States government collects data on gender and racial demographics of business owners who receive contracts—as long as they aren’t white or male. Contractors are given the opportunity to be certified as part of racial and ethnic groups, where they can select multiple identity categories as well as “other minority.” Contractors are also able to be certified as women, women-owned-small-business, women-owned-disadvantaged-business, or joint-venture-women-owned-small-business. There are no non-binary gender options.

While we wanted to reveal the troubling cooperation of people belonging to these categories, we did not want to do so in a mode that was equivalent to the government’s use of this data: demonstrating equal opportunity. Nor did we want our visualization to look like a critique of an absence of diversity in the data set—as though we think there should be *greater* participation of people in protected categories in the machinery of ICE detention. Therefore, when designing the pie charts we consciously avoided any comparisons that would encourage that narrative. Moreover, because this demographic data is opt-in and marked only with “t” for true (indicating belonging to a category) or “f” for false, those kinds of comparisons could be wholly inaccurate—there is simply no way to know whether contractors belonging to these categories chose not to be certified.

However, we ran into a further challenge: how do we represent intersectional identity? Government data itself is not operationalized to account for intersectionality, so we prototyped several visualization ideas, from a single pie chart to a Euler diagram to multiple pie charts for gender, race and ethnicity, and intersectionality. We ultimately opted for bar charts, instead of our original pie charts, to represent this data more accurately.

We also encountered challenges when relying on government classifications for goods and services. When designing Freezer, we wanted to convey the complex interplay of contractors, goods, and services that support ICE operations. Many contractors provide different types of products and services, often through multiple contracts, while others only provide one. "Murderboard" depicts this material and financial web, while "ICE Tray" clusters contractors in smaller groups to show where the money is going. What those groups should look like, however, was an open question for our team. Government contracting data deploys a number of categorization schemes to describe goods and services; the most controlled of these vocabularies are the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the government's Product and Service Code (PSC) Manual. We discovered, however, that the categories did not align with each other or with specific details of goods and services in any meaningful ways. Recognizing that any scheme would be limited, we chose to create our own taxonomy: a decolonial ontology that groups goods and services through the ideological, carceral, managerial, and material categories that support immigrant detention, enforcement, and deportation. In doing so, we call attention to the roles of *Surveillance*; the *Flow of Goods and Bodies*; the *Staples* of office life and administration; the *Threat of Violence*; the *Reforming Bodies* facilitated by goods like medicine and uniforms; the construction and upkeep of *Walls*; the whirring of *Machines*; the *Doctrine* of churches, instruction and advertising; and the *Mixed Bag* for random contracts facilitating ICE operations.

Another critical tension arose over the extent to which we should directly prescribe a course of action through Vol. 2. Some team members favored offering direct ways to engage with ICE’s government contractors. Others were concerned that for sole proprietors or other individuals whose contact information is in the data set, this would be tantamount to doxxing. Ultimately, in the spirit of Vol. 1, we erred on the side of telling stories with data without articulating an agenda for their use. We leave that to our readers, particularly those with experience in organizing.


## The Endgame


> Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats want to abolish the brave men and women of
ICE. What I want to do is abolish the killers in ISIS. And you know who is
going to win? We are.[^1]

What was the endgame of ICE, we asked ourselves? In Vol. 1, we saw the vast territory of containment that ICE had linked, built or purchased. The vast majority of our dots on that map, however, were, small round dots, signifying un-use. They had held no ICE detainees. Why was ICE amassing infrastructure that seemed unlinked to the crisis of family detainment on the southern borders? As we planned Vol. 2, we began to map out this world.

An initial line of inquiry was to examine capacity. ICE has nearly 2000 facilities, the vast majority of which are "currently not in use." However, ICE maintains data on their average daily population (ADP). We wanted to call this collective number "capacity." ICE wanted to make “[rapid judgments](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/04/sessions-immigration-judges-should-complete-700-cases-per-year/)” or carry out “civil criminalization” - deportation without the right  of going before a judge. We wanted to call this the "churn rate." Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration have [a figure of 12.5 million](https://www.fairus.org/issue/illegal-immigration/how-many-illegal-immigrants-are-in-us) so-called “Illegal Aliens” in the country. We wanted to call this the First Target (T1) for mass deportation. Subsequently, we created "Beds" as a representation of the ADP. However, we were unable to create a visualization of future-scaling because we could not identify the churn rate. The fingerprints of the architects of this infrastructure are untraceable at the moment. The infrastructure remains banal, in plain view, and dormant. Sections of its policing, detention, and deportation arms are being activated in stages. It is lying in wait.

![Prototype for "Beds"](/torn-apart/assets/imgs/v2/beds-screencap.png)

Another line of inquiry we pursued was examining “denaturalization”: stripping United States citizenship from [naturalized citizens](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article214173489.html). The process started in earnest in 2014, part of a wider project to protect the "[integrity of U.S. Citizenship](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/usab65&div=32&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals#)." In 2014, a program first called "Operation Targeting Groups of Inadmissable Subjects" and, later, "Operation Janus" was granted approximately $5 million by Congress to comb through records and identify those who may have re-applied for citizenship under a second name. The strategy began to bear fruit early [in 2018](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-first-denaturalization-result-operation-janus). The 2019 budget includes an ask for a further $207.6 million to fund [Operation Second Look](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/U.S.%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement.pdf), which would target an estimated 700,000 records [with the potential to be de-naturalized](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-10/us-using-expanded-fingerprint-database-review-citizenship-thousands-americans). We went through case-law databases and were able to isolate over 90 cases of denaturalizations, the majority of which were people of South Asian descent. However, we did not know how best to proceed with the visualization without de-anonymizing the cases and without criminalizing sub-sections of United States communities.

An additional line of inquiry we considered  was the throttling of paths to citizenship—[especially birthright](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/opinion/trump-birthright-citizenship-mccarthy.html). The Trump administration is doing this by restricting who is deemed eligible to apply for change of legal status—rejecting those from certain countries, those who had previously made claims on public funds, or those who have previous records. Much of this, under current law, would not deter anyone from gaining citizenship or legal status. However, the current administration wants to, in effect, create newer classes of sub-citizens who would be at continuous risk of being deemed/declared “illegal.” This remains the most forward-looking part of citizenship throttling, but we simply did not have the data to visualize it.

We failed to do any of these proposed visualizations for future predictive visualizations. Yet all of this data lead us to the same conclusion: the infrastructure of detainment, denaturalization, and deportation is massive, and its targets are not just those attempting to get in, but also those who have been here for decades and decades.

## The Media Barometer

Another phenomenon we wanted to investigate, but ultimately could not visualize, was the role of news media in immigrant detention: Who is talking about ICE operations? Where? How often? In what contexts? Even more importantly, what is not being talked about? Using news APIs and RSS feeds, we tried to explore these questions through local media sources. We were able to successfully extract headlines and snippets of stories from RSS feeds and to scrape returned URLs from news APIs to retrieve full articles. Unfortunately, it proved difficult to directly compare how different county news sources wrote about their local detention centers.

The number of news hits about each detention facility that we pulled from API searches correlated inversely with the length of the detention center's name, suggesting that longer names were being abbreviated in some way and thus eluding our searches. More general searches using key terms associated with ICE operations did not suffer from this specific limitation but proved to be hampered by limitations of the APIs we were using and the unreliability of the data they returned. These APIs returned responses that included articles from dates outside our search parameters, did not include recent news from many news sources that the APIs claimed to index, and only included a small percent of the total articles from others. Furthermore, API responses for different counties were unrepresentative of the relevant media sources, while all free APIs we used limited the number of calls we could make per day, which made it too difficult to finesse our searches in a timely manner. Ultimately we did not want to risk misrepresenting the media landscape.

During these efforts, however, we were able to draw some general characterizations about the mediascape. For one, we can confirm that news stories about ICE operations and detention centers are numerous enough that they would reward an approach to their analysis that can address the difficulties we ran into. Our API searches returned more than 2,200 stories mentioning detention centers by name and containing relevant keywords just in the last month, and our subsequent benchmarking of the API responses suggests that this only represents a small percentage of the total stories written during this time. It is also clear that even small local news sources frequently have some news content about ICE detention. And finally, initial analysis suggests there are differences in how different regions' news sources write about the key terms, even though we were not sufficiently satisfied with the representativeness of our data to go into more detail at this stage.

## Passing on the Baton

After Vol. 1, we imagined passing on the model of *Torn Apart/Separados* to new teams. The [design and prototype sprints](https://www.hastac.org/blogs/danicasavonick/2018/07/08/torn-apartseparados-hackathon-hastac-meet-recap) we held at the DH2018 conference in Mexico City were part of our efforts to share our rapid approach and ethos. Vol. 2 took longer to produce—though still at light speed in academic years. We had a larger team, had more complex data sets, and had to tend to other commitments. In both cases, however, model workflows can be abstracted, and we will make that available through the [Nimble Tents Toolkit](https://nimbletents.github.io) in the near future for others who would like to replicate our model with other subject matter or who would like to take on the mantle of rapidly-deployed ICE research. For those who take on the latter, we did our best here to list some of our remaining questions, but there are many more. For example, we know that data from "sanctuary" cities leaks to ICE through [CopLink](https://theappeal.org/new-documents-reveal-how-ice-mines-local-police-databases-across-the-country-660e2dfddbe3/) and what are known as [Fusion Centers](https://www.aclu.org/other/more-about-fusion-centers). How would a macroscopic view of these data flows look? Will you be the one to answer?

We are happy to [pass on our data](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data) and lessons learned to the teams that take on these challenges. Just drop us a line at tornapartseparados@gmail.com if you have any questions.
