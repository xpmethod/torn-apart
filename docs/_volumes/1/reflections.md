# Reflections
{: data-i18n="ta-reflections"}

Our visualizations and data are mere parts of this larger story. As scholars
of space, race, gender, and the digital, members of our team are contributing
their own reflections on what this project means to them and how they are
reacting to the news.  

As we have gathered and curated this data and produced these visualizations,
we share certain underlying assumptions: the express knowledge that data is
imprecise, impure, and as much a tool for incarceration and control as it is
for revealing the truth; that maps, which have become of primary importance to
our daily life, are themselves highly contingent fabrications, bending the
physical reality of the world to our innate need to grasp and process, and
dangerously full of altered data.

Hence, in addition to reflections from our own project group, we have reached
out to a small group of historians, activists, artists, and writers to provide
their own readings of our curated data and visualizations. 

We provide all the reflections below in order to help contextualize both our
impetus and our efforts.
