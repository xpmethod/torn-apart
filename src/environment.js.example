// This is an example of an environment file. This file should be copied to a
// new file, called "environment.mjs," and then it can be invoked as such:
//
// include config from "./environment";
//
// which provides the config object, so the apiKey can be gotten via:
//
// config.newsApiKey

export default {
  newsApiKey: "SOME STRING FROM newsapi.org"
