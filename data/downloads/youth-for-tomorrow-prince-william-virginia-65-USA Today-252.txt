Mavericks owner Mark Cuban let J.J. Barea use the team plane to get supplies to Puerto Rico and to bring his mother and grandmother back to the states this week, according to ESPN‘s Tim MacMahon.

Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria and is now facing a “monumental recovery effort,” per USA TODAY. MacMahon noted that Barea is the only active NBA player who’s a Puerto Rico native.

Mark Cuban loaned the team plane to J.J. Barea to fly supplies to Puerto Rico. Barea will return tonight with his mother and grandmother.

Here’s more from Cuban and head coach Rick Carlisle, per ESPN:

“I was really proud of J.J. and how quickly he got involved and how hard he worked to make all of this happen,” Cuban told ESPN in a text message.

“That’s a situation that he’s got to take care of,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “Mark gave him our team plane. They loaded up a bunch of stuff, supplies, etc., to take over to Puerto Rico, and they’re going to turn around and come back. He’s going to take his mom and grandmother back with him, and my understanding is his dad is going to stay over there and slug it out with all of the recovery efforts.”

Barea and his wife Viviana Ortiz set up a donation page that has raised more than $100,000 as of Tuesday, Sept. 26. In the comments section of the donation page, Ortiz explains how the money will be used:

“We are going to manage everything personally with J.J. Barea Foundation and our contacts in Puerto Rico. The Foundation was established by J.J. Barea when he started to play in the NBA. Since its inception, the foundation has been helping communities in Puerto Rico develop facilities for youth sports. However, with this tragedy the Foundation is determined to contribute to the rebuilding of Puerto Rico. From helping with shelters (food, water, necessities etc.) to rebuilding communities. JJ his family and the Foundation are determined to help Puerto Rico and its strong people get back on their feet. We are going to find out the most urgent needs and we go from there.”

Ortiz, who’s a Puerto Rican actress and model, posted photos of the plane on Instagram and thanked the Dallas community for their support.
