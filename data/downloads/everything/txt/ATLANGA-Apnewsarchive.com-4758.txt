PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) — The Latest on the nationwide student walkout to protest gun violence (all times local):

5:50 p.m.

The walkouts protesting gun violence at schools across the country hit close to home for students who were attending a middle school in northern Nevada when tragedy hit their campus more than four years ago.

Sparks High School Principal Kevin Carroll says some of his seniors were students at nearby Sparks Middle School when a seventh-grader opened fire on the school playground in October 2013.

Jose Reyes fatally shot Sparks Middle School teacher Michael Landsberry and injured two classmates before turning the gun on himself.

About 200 students at Sparks High participated in Wednesday's walkout.

Carroll told the Reno Gazette Journal he thinks the protest had the biggest impact on those who experienced the fatal shooting in 2013. He says it was "kind of heartening" to see them participate in the rally.

An unspecified threat at one northern Nevada high school kept most of its students from walking out of class to participate in a nationwide protest marking the one-month anniversary of a Florida school shooting.

The Douglas County sheriff's office says a stay-put order was issued at Douglas High School in Gardnerville south of Carson City on Wednesday shortly after the threat was received at about 9:30 a.m.

Deputies and state troopers patrolled the campus and surrounding area before they determined there was no danger and the order was lifted by 11 a.m.

The Record-Courier reports three students managed to make their way out of the school and briefly joined more than a dozen adults who rallied with signs outside.

An officer escorted them back inside the school, which plans to reschedule its demonstration for another day.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is commending students for speaking up on school safety during Wednesday's national student walkout.

Hill adds, "She hears them, and their input will be valuable."

DeVos has said arming teachers should be an option for those schools and communities who want it.

DeVos will chair a federal commission tasked with student safety. On Tuesday, she met with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the committee overseeing education. Murray complained that DeVos didn't provide any specifics on the commission's work and would not discuss any role the National Rifle Association may have in its work.

According to watchdog group The Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA has spent nearly $7 million to support Burr's campaigns over his career.

Protesters held signs saying "Books Not Bullets" and "Is 7 Million Dollars Worth 17 People's Lives?"

Some motorists honked their car horns in support. One driver told the group to protest opioids because guns don't kill, drugs do. One protester responded, "They both do.!"
